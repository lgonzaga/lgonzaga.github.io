This blog is mostly about hands on experience on computer vision, computer  graphics and mainly immersion visualisation. I’ve written about  cross-platform development applied on oil &amp; gas exploration, genetics and transportation. I’ve also experimented with C++, Python, OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenCV, and so on .
